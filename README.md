The Crops Inventory Management System streamlines crop management, from inventory tracking to order processing, with a focus on buyer interactions. Crops are stored in a TreeMap for efficient sorting, and buyers can create accounts, browse crops, and place orders through the User Interface. Orders are processed using an abstract OrderProcessor class, with specific types (regular or bulk orders) handled by subclasses like BulkOrderProcessor.

The InventoryManagement class monitors crop stocks, extending the abstract Product class to include details like expiration dates and status. Alerts notify admins when crops near expiration. Buyers manage their orders and account details via the Buyer class, which integrates with OrderManagement to track order histories and statuses (e.g., "Pending" to "Shipped"). The modular design, using abstract classes, ensures scalability, allowing seamless integration of new product types and order strategies while maintaining efficient operations and a personalized buyer experience.
